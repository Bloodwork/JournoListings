# JournoListings

JournoListings is a free and open-source browser extension to alert consumers of journalistic-content of potential conflicts of interest.  As the shift from

The [Society of Professional Journalists](https://www.spj.org/) defines an [ethics code](https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp) for journalists to strive for and abide by.  Private mailing lists may enable an echo-chamber of ideas, a chilling-effect for dissenting opinion, and biased narrative shaping.  A journalist that participates in private journalist mailing lists most likely abides by the SPJ Ethics Code, but it is important for the consumers of their content to be aware of such influences as group-think or hidden incentives.

Several sections of the [ethics code](https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp) may become compromised in the presence of group-think or private echo-chambers.

* Identify sources clearly. The public is entitled to as much information as possible to judge the reliability and motivations of sources.
* Recognize a special obligation to serve as watchdogs over public affairs and government. Seek to ensure that the publicâ€™s business is conducted in the open, and that public records are open to all.
* Label advocacy and commentary.
* Never deliberately distort facts or context, including visual information. Clearly label illustrations and re-enactments.
* Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Disclose unavoidable conflicts.
* Deny favored treatment to advertisers, donors or any other special interests, and resist internal and external pressure to influence coverage.
* Distinguish news from advertising and shun hybrids that blur the lines between the two. Prominently label sponsored content.
* Expose unethical conduct in journalism, including within their organizations.

The JournoListings extension alerts users on a variety of websites as to which journalists have been on private mailing lists that have been proven to shape narratives or collude with independent organizations.  The two most well known include JournoList and GameJournoPros.

This browser extension was inspired by the wonderful work of Ian Webster's [AdDetector](http://ianww.com/ad-detector) extension for alerting to native-advertising.  JournoListings highly recommends you check out his extension and thank him for helping to improve the quality of online journalism.

JournoListings would like to thank [Politico for the exposure of JournoList](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/20086.html), [Milo Yiannopoulos for covering GameJournoPros](http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-London/2014/09/17/Exposed-the-secret-mailing-list-of-the-gaming-journalism-elite), and most of all, to the sources that made such coverage possible!
